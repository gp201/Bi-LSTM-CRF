Pseudomonas	aeruginosa	(Pa)	infection	in	cystic	fibrosis	(CF)	patients	is	associated	with	worse	long-term	pulmonary	disease	and	shorter	survival,	and	chronic	Pa	infection	(CPA)	is	associated	with	reduced	lung	function,	faster	rate	of	lung	decline,	increased	rates	of	exacerbations	and	shorter	survival

By	using	exome	sequencing	and	extreme	phenotype	design,	it	was	recently	shown	that	isoforms	of	dynactin	4	(DCTN4)	may	influence	Pa	infection	in	CF,	leading	to	worse	respiratory	disease

The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	investigate	the	role	of	DCTN4	missense	variants	on	Pa	infection	incidence,	age	at	first	Pa	infection	and	chronic	Pa	infection	incidence	in	a	cohort	of	adult	CF	patients	from	a	single	centre

A	total	of	121	adult	CF	patients	from	the	Cochin	Hospital	CF	centre	have	been	included,	all	of	them	carrying	two	CFTR	defects:	103	developed	at	least	1	pulmonary	infection	with	Pa,	and	68	patients	of	them	had	CPA

DCTN4	variants	were	identified	in	24%	(29/121)	CF	patients	with	Pa	infection	and	in	only	17%	(3/18)	CF	patients	with	no	Pa	infection
