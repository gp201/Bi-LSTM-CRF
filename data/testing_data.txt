Pseudomonas	aeruginosa	(Pa)	infection	in	cystic	fibrosis	(CF)	patients	is	associated	with	worse	long-term	pulmonary	disease	and	shorter	survival,	and	chronic	Pa	infection	(CPA)	is	associated	with	reduced	lung	function,	faster	rate	of	lung	decline,	increased	rates	of	exacerbations	and	shorter	survival
